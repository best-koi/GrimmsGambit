    _line: 'As you turn to look for Katze in his usual spots, you surprisingly find
      him sitting near the fire. '
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: Still a ways away from everyone else, but also not in some shadowy corner
      like usual.

    _line: "You\u2019re sitting."

    _line: Is such an act prohibited? If so, I believe you should be talking with
      the Seamstress first.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: "No, it's just\u2026 surprising. I thought you\u2019d be leaning against
      a tree like usual."

    _line: Huh. I guess I probably should be.

    _line: "You\u2019ve changed a lot since we fought the beast. You\u2019re usually
      a lot more chatty and roundabout with your words."

    _line: "I suppose I have. It\u2019s not everyday that you find out the vile monster
      you\u2019ve been trying to kill turns out to be seven kids in a wolf-coat."
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: Definitely one of the more unexpected outcomes. You think your employer
      knew about this?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: "Maybe. It just means that I\u2019ll have to use my silver tongue to convince
      them that the monster is dead."
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: You plan on lying to them?

    _line: When have I ever claimed to be honest?

    _line: "Do you think you\u2019re ready for tomorrow\u2019s battle?"
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: "As ready as I\u2019ve always been. I gave you my guarantee."

    _line: "Thought you weren\u2019t the honest type?"

    _line: I consider myself a shrewd man when it comes to obligations.

    _line: Fair enough.

    _line: Actually, one more thing before you go.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: Hm?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Thank you, truthfully. I fear that I may have been on the precipice of
      making a terrible mistake, and your words swayed my judgement otherwise.
