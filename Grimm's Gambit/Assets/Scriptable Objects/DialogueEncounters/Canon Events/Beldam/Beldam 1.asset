  - Moving forward you find the floor beneath you begins to become damp as the path
    before you leads through a swampland.
  - You travel some distance until you spot what appears to be an overgrown water
    well built covered in moss and lichen.
  - As you approach you can smell rot and decay drifting from the well.
  - "You can\u2019t help but gag being in its proximity. Seemingly from nowhere a
    woman appears behind you."
  - Have you come to make an offering?
  - Who goes there!
  - Pardon my abruptness. No need to fear. The people of these lands call me the
    Beldam.
  - I help lost travelers find what they seek.
