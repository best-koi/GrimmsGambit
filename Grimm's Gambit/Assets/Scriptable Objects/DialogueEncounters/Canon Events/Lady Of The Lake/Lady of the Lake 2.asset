    _line: Yet, despite Katze's warning, the Hound pads forward, stopping to sit
      at attention at the water's edge. Although your loyal protector usually takes
      the frontlines, something about him seems different. There is a sense of purpose
      in how he composes himself.

    _line: O noble beast who would carry these travelers from harm, are you satisfied?

    _line: The woman's lilting tone sounds metered, yet sorrowful all the same. It's
      only natural her words strike a chord with the Hound. Slowly, the dog turns
      toward you, expectantly.

      in turning back toward the lady in the lake, bowing its head.)

    _line: I see. Not much for thinking ahead, hm? Then I'm sure a straight-minded
      beast like you will be able to manage just fine.
