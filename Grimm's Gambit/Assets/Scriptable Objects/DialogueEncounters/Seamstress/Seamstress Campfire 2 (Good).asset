    _line: You approach the Seamstress. Ever since you stopped traveling and set
      up camp she has been furious at work sewing something, but you are unsure as
      to what.
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: You are able to step in front of her before she finally notices you.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Oh! Pardon me, hun. Got a bit lost in my work for a second. Everything
      alright?
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: I just wanted to check in with you. How are you feeling after our encounter
      with the Beldam?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Well... I think I'm fine. I think... No. *sigh* I'll be straight with
      you. I don't know how I feel yet. I'm a bit lost at the moment.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: Does it have something to do with that doll?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: '*sigh* yes... That doll was supposed to be a gift for my daughter. My
      daughter which that cheating Odds took from me.'
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: There is a pause in her speech as you see her eyes water slightly. She
      takes a deep breath and puts on her calm composure once more.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: But none of that matters anymore. I can't change the past, nor my mistakes.
      But I can fight to make sure I don't lose what I have now. Which reminds me.
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: She reaches down to grab what she has been working on, revealing a knitted
      sweater seemingly handmade for you.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: This is for you! I know it's not much, but I've been needing to do something
      with my hands to ease the mind and this seemed like the perfect place to put
      my efforts.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: I hope it fits. I sort of eyeballed your proportions.
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: You try on the sweater. It is warm and fuzzy and made with thick enough
      material that you feel it will provide some protection in your journey going
      forward.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Well. What do you think?
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: It's wonderful. Thank you.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Of course, hun. Now I think it's best if I turn in for the night. Sleep
      well.
