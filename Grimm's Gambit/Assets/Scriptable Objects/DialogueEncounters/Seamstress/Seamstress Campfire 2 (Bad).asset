    _line: You approach the Seamstress. She states blankly into the forest facing
      in the direction where you know the Odds awaits you with her back to the campfire.
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: You are able to approach her and place a hand on her shoulder before she
      notices your approach. In her lap is the doll which she clutches with both
      hands.

    _line: Hello dear. Is something wrong?
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: Are you alright? You've been acting strange lately.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Have I? Odd. I suppose I have been feeling happier as of late, but I wouldn't
      call that strange.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: More that you've been distant.

    _line: There is much to think about. We're only half way through our journey,
      but all I can think about is what happens when we reach the Odds.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: Do you still seek an end to the Odds?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: I seek peace... I want to stop seeing the eyes of my daughter everytime
      I close my eyes.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: But at the very same time I never want to forget them for it's all I have
      left of her.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: And maybe... just maybe knowing that crooked man can never hurt anyone
      ever again will let me see her eyes and smile. Just smile. Nothing more. That's
      what I want.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: I see...
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: I'm going to get some rest now. You should too...
