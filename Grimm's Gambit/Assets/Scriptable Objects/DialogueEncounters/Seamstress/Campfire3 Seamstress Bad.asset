  lines:
  - As you approach the Seamstress she sits seemingly lost in thought. She stares
    upwards towards the moon. She bears a frown and seems to be deep in contemplation.
  - Are you ready for tomorrow?
  - No. I don't think I ever could be ready. But I have to be. Starting tomorrow
    all things come to a close.
  - You still seek revenge?
  - I seek peace. And if that means taking out the Odds to do it, then it will be
    done. He'll never hurt anyone ever again.
  - What happens after?
  - I don't know. But I can't think about that right now, I'll figure that out after
    the job is done.
  - Her brow furrows and she averts her gaze from the moon and turns to face the
    campfire. She stares into the embers a few moments still deep in thought.
  - You should get some sleep soon, dear. I need a few minutes longer to think.
