  lines:
  - As you approach the Seamstress she sits seemingly lost in thought. She stares
    upwards towards the moon with a soft smile on her face.
  - As you sit beside her she speaks to you eyes still entrances by the beauty of
    the night sky.
  - I think I'm finally ready.
  - To face the Odds?
  - No. For everything that comes after that. For the first time in a very long time
    I think I'm finally excited to see what the future holds in store for me. It's
    thrilling.
  - What is it that you want when all this is done?
  - I'm not sure. A second chance at family I think is a good start. Someone to share
    the nights with.
  - A home that finally feels like home. Maybe a croissant. Really the possibilities
    are endless.
  - A croissant... Yes, truly endless possibilities indeed...
  - With chocolate chips too! Heh. But in all seriousness I really don't know.
  - All I know is that I'm ready to meet whatever life awaits me in sanctuary. Tomorrow
    is the beginning of a new chapter.
  - Do you still seek vengeance on the Odds?
  - Vengeance? No, not anymore. Maybe a stern talking to and a slap across the face
    to set his crooked heart in place, but not vengeance.
  - Together you sit entranced by moonlight.
  - Well, tomorrow won't come faster by staring at the moon to go down faster. I'm
    off to get some rest. Sleep well... and thank you.
