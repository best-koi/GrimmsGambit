    _line: As you approach the Seamstress she sits seemingly lost in thought. She
      stares upwards towards the moon with a soft smile on her face.
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: As you sit beside her she speaks to you eyes still entrances by the beauty
      of the night sky.

    _line: I think I'm finally ready.

    _line: To face the Odds?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: No. For everything that comes after that. For the first time in a very
      long time I think I'm finally excited to see what the future holds in store
      for me. It's thrilling.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: What is it that you want when all this is done?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: I'm not sure. A second chance at family I think is a good start. Someone
      to share the nights with.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: A home that finally feels like home. Maybe a croissant. Really the possibilities
      are endless.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: A croissant... Yes, truly endless possibilities indeed...
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: With chocolate chips too! Heh. But in all seriousness I really don't know.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: All I know is that I'm ready to meet whatever life awaits me in sanctuary.
      Tomorrow is the beginning of a new chapter.
  - _speaker: 1
    _line: Do you still seek vengeance on the Odds?
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Vengeance? No, not anymore. Maybe a stern talking to and a slap across
      the face to set his crooked heart in place, but not vengeance.
  - _speaker: 2
    _line: Together you sit entranced by moonlight.
  - _speaker: 0
    _line: Well, tomorrow won't come faster by staring at the moon to go down faster.
      I'm off to get some rest. Sleep well... and thank you.
