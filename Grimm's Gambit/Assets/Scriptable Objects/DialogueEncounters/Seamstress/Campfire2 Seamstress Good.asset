  lines:
  - You approach the Seamstress. Ever since you stopped traveling and set up camp
    she has been furious at work sewing something, but you are unsure as to what.
  - You are able to step in front of her before she finally notices you.
  - Oh! Pardon me, hun. Got a bit lost in my work for a second. Everything alright?
  - I just wanted to check in with you. How are you feeling after our encounter with
    the Beldam?
  - Well... I think I'm fine. I think... No. *sigh* I'll be straight with you. I
    don't know how I feel yet. I'm a bit lost at the moment.
  - Does it have something to do with that doll?
  - '*sigh* yes... That doll was supposed to be a gift for my daughter. My daughter
    which that cheating Odds took from me.'
  - There is a pause in her speech as you see her eyes water slightly. She takes
    a deep breath and puts on her calm composure once more.
  - But none of that matters anymore. I can't change the past, nor my mistakes. But
    I can fight to make sure I don't lose what I have now. Which reminds me.
  - She reaches down to grab what she has been working on, revealing a knitted sweater
    seemingly handmade for you.
  - This is for you! I know it's not much, but I've been needing to do something
    with my hands to ease the mind and this seemed like the perfect place to put
    my efforts.
  - I hope it fits. I sort of eyeballed your proportions.
  - You try on the sweater. It is warm and fuzzy and made with thick enough material
    that you feel it will provide some protection in your journey going forward.
  - Well. What do you think?
  - It's wonderful. Thank you.
  - Of course, hun. Now I think it's best if I turn in for the night. Sleep well.
