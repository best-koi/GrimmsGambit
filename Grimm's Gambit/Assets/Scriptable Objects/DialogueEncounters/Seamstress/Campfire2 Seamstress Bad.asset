  lines:
  - You approach the Seamstress. Ever since you stopped traveling and set up camp
    she has been furious at work sewing something, but you are unsure as to what.
  - You are able to step in front of her before she finally notices you.
  - Oh! Pardon me, hun. Got a bit lost in my work for a second. Everything alright?
  - I just wanted to check in with you. How are you feeling after our encounter with
    the Beldam?
  - Well... I think I'm fine. I think... No. *sigh* I'll be straight with you. I
    don't know how I feel yet. I'm a bit lost at the moment.
  - Does it have something to do with that doll?
  - '*sigh* yes... That doll was supposed to be a gift for my daughter. My daughter
    which that cheating Odds took from me.'
  - There is a pause in her speech as you see her eyes water slightly. She takes
    a deep breath and puts on her calm composure once more.
  - But none of that matters anymore. I can't change the past, nor my mistakes. But
    I can fight to make sure I don't lose what I have now. Which reminds me.
