  lines:
  - You approach the Seamstress. She states blankly into the forest facing in the
    direction where you know the Odds awaits you with her back to the campfire.
  - You are able to approach her and place a hand on her shoulder before she notices
    your approach. In her lap is the doll which she clutches with both hands.
  - Hello dear. Is something wrong?
  - Are you alright? You've been acting strange lately.
  - Have I? Odd. I suppose I have been feeling happier as of late, but I wouldn't
    call that strange.
  - More that you've been distant.
  - There is much to think about. We're only half way through our journey, but all
    I can think about is what happens when we reach the Odds.
  - Do you still seek an end to the Odds?
  - I seek peace... I want to stop seeing the eyes of my daughter everytime I close
    my eyes.
  - But at the very same time I never want to forget them for it's all I have left
    of her.
  - And maybe... just maybe knowing that crooked man can never hurt anyone ever again
    will let me see her eyes and smile. Just smile. Nothing more. That's what I want.
  - I see...
  - I'm going to get some rest now. You should too...
