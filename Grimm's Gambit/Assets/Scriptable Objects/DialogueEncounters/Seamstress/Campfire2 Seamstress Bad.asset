  lines:
  - You approach the Seamstress. She states blankly into the forest facing in the
    direction where you know the Odds awaits you with her back to the campfire.
  - You are able to approach her and place a hand on her shoulder before she notices
    your approach. In her lap is the doll which she clutches with both hands.
  - Hello dear. Is something wrong?
  - Are you alright? You've been acting strange lately.
  - Have I? Odd. I suppose I have been feeling happier as of late, but I wouldn't
    call that strange.
  - I have a feeling there is something wrong with that doll-
  - You reach your hand in the direction of the doll gesturing in its direction and
    the Seamstress jerks away from your hand defensively, tucking the doll under
    her arm, kicking spores into the air.
  - DON'T TOUCH!
  - Sorry...
  - No. No, I'm fine. It's fine. Just lost my temper is all. Everything's okay. I
    think I shall turn in for the night. Good night, deary.
