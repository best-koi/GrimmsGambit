  - 'You approach the Seamstress. She sits by the fire weaving twine and string into
    a beautiful pattern. '
  - 'As you approach she glances up from her work, pausing before putting her supplies
    away and giving you her full attention. She gives you a weary smile. '
  - 'Good day to you! Err- evening I suppose.  '
  - 'Good evening. I wish to speak with you. '
  - "I\u2019d like to get to know you a little better. What can you tell me about
    yourself? "
  - "Well I am but a humble seamstress. Fortunately, the ascension of the Red Queen
    hasn\u2019t tampered with people\u2019s need for clothes, granted not many want
    to pay nor can they afford my finer talents nowadays...   "
  - "I\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2026 "
  - "Don\u2019t you worry your pretty head bout me or my struggles. You\u2019ve got
    to keep your mind on your goals and that\u2019s showing that crooked Odds what
    for.   "
  - 'Why are you helping me? Surely there is something you wish to get out of this. '
  - "Hmm\u2026 Well hun, to tell you the truth I have a bit of a bone to pick with
    that old-headed Odds you seek."
  - 'Do you have a gambit you wish to make as well? '
  - "No. No, not really. Look, my intents with the Odds are my own. For now let\u2019s
    just say I\u2019d like to see an end to his crooked games.   "
  - 'And how exactly do you plan to achieve that? '
  - "\u2026"
  - "\u2026"
  - "I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll know when the time is right. "
  - "Was nice talking to you, hun. Try and get some rest, we\u2019ve got a long day
    ahead of us."
