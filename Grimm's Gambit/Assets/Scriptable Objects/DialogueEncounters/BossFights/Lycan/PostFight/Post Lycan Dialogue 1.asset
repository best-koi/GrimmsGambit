  - "As the terrible beast falls, the tattered body begins to writhe and struggle
    as if something was crawling under the creature\u2019s skin."
  - Katze steps forwards, and in a single slash cuts the beast open.
  - Inside are a bunch of young teens, each with fear adorning their eyes. It seems
    the beast was nothing more than a furry costume puppeteered by children.
  - "\"Damn! He must\u2019ve known\u2026\""
