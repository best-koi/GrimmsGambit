  - Yet, despite Katze's warning, the Hound pads forward, stopping to sit at attention
    at the water's edge. Although your loyal protector usually takes the frontlines,
    something about him seems different. There is a sense of purpose in how he composes
    himself.
  - Out of the lake emerges a woman, clothed in some sort of water-resistant dress.
    She pauses to size up your party, before turning to the Hound.
  - '"O noble beast who would carry these travelers from harm, are you satisfied?
    You would think your purpose of deliverance to Sanctuary just, I''m certain,
    yet will you be able to part from these three when the journey is done?"'
  - The woman's lilting tone sounds metered, yet sorrowful all the same. It's only
    natural her words strike a chord with the Hound. Slowly, the dog turns toward
    you, expectantly.
  - (The Hound seems bewildered by your response. And yet, it does not falter in
    turning back toward the lady in the lake, bowing its head.)
  - '"I see. Not much for thinking ahead, hm? Then I''m sure a straight-minded beast
    like you will be able to manage just fine."'
