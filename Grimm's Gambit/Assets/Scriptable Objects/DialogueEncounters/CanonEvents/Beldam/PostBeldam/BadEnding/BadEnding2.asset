  - 'She looks down at the doll with hesitation. A sense of resolve washes over their
    face as she hands the doll to the Beldam. '
  - 'I trust you.  '
  - The Beldam places the doll into the moss covered bucket and begins to turn the
    crank.
  - It descends down into the pungent murk below. Eventually the crank stops having
    reached its limit.
  - Sounds erupt from the bottom of the well of something strange shifting in the
    waters below.
  - 'The Beldam begins to wind the crank in the opposite direction. '
  - The bucket rises above the edge of the well.
  - Inside resides the doll now dampened by the waters below. It is returned covered
    in spores and dull colored mushrooms.
  - How beautiful! Now, take your prize for your bravery, deary.
  - 'This pain will make me stronger... '
  - With cold emotionless eyes that carry the tiredness and emptied emotions as a
    result of bearing this pain for so long, she reaches forward grabbing the doll.
  - The Seamstress stares blankly into its soulless lichen covered eyes.
  - Her breathing becomes labored as a flood of emotions overcomes her.
  - Some of the spores enter her lungs as she breathes with this doll in proximity.
    As she does, tears begin to roll down her face.
  - 'There we are. That is the face of someone who knows what they must do to get
    what they want. Tell me, how does it feel? '
  - "I don\u2019t know\u2026 I think the pain is finally gone. "
  - And what do you feel now?
