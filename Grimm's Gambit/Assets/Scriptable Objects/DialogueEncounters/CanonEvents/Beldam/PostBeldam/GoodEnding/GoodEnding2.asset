  - 'She looks down at the doll with hesitation. A sense of resolve washes over their
    face as she hands the doll to the Beldam. '
  - 'I trust you.  '
  - The Beldam places the doll into the moss covered bucket and begins to turn the
    crank.
  - It descends down into the pungent murk below. Eventually the crank stops having
    reached its limit.
  - Sounds erupt from the bottom of the well of something strange shifting in the
    waters below.
  - 'The Beldam begins to wind the crank in the opposite direction. '
  - The bucket rises above the edge of the well.
  - Inside resides the doll now dampened by the waters below. It is returned covered
    in spores and dull colored mushrooms.
  - How beautiful! Now, take your prize for your bravery, deary.
  - The Seamstress stares at the twisted and corrupted doll with a look of disgust.
  - She turns her back to the doll and stares towards the ground blankly.
  - "Let\u2019s leave. I don\u2019t think I can stand this place any longer."
  - But deary, what about your prize? What about-
  - "Stop. Just stop. You wanted me to feel pain, congratulations. You succeeded.
    But I won\u2019t carry around that twisted idol."
  - Not anymore
  - "But what about the Odds? Shouldn\u2019t he feel the same pain? "
  - "You\u2019ve taken something that was a symbol of new beginnings and turned it
    into a reminder of fate\u2019s bitter temperance."
  - "The Odds will get what\u2019s coming to him. That does not mean it must be done
    with hatred in heart. "
  - "Ragh! Fine! If you don\u2019t want my help then leave why don\u2019t you. It\u2019s
    your grave not mine! "
