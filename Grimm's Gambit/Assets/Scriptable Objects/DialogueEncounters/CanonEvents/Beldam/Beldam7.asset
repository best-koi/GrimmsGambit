  - 'The Seamstress reaches into her bag, fetching a hand sewn doll. '
  - "Ooooo, yes. This reeks of suffering. Anger. Regret. Loss\u2026 Wonderful. "
  - The Beldam reaches out an open hand expectantly, waiting for the Seamstress to
    make a decision.
  - 'She looks to you seemingly at a loss for what to do. '
  - This was the doll I made for my child. The child that the Odds stole from me.
  - "I had planned to give it to her but was never given the chance. I\u2019ve kept
    it with me to remind me why I\u2019m on this journey in the first place."
  - 'Can this really be the right thing to do? '
