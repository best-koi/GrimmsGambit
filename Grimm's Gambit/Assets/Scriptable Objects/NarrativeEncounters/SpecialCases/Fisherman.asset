  description: '"Cutting through the thicket ahead is a thin, grimy river. Beached
    on the banks of this unassuming brook is a small fish, some sort of freshwater
    flounder, it seems. As your party approaches it, you notice a note scrawled by
    an unsteady hand pinned to the fish by a hook:"  ''I have left this flounder
    here to offer a moral quandary to those who would pass by. Should you remove
    the hook and return this specimen to the river, you should have good fortune.
    If you should not, it will die here, and you will continue on as nothing had
    happened.''  "''Could be a trap. Or some ripe fool trying to have a laugh at
    others'' expense. But maybe that''s just my skepticism talking. What would you
    have us do?'' comments Die Katze." '

    and all that. But then by that logic, your ''villainous act'' deserves a little
    something, too.'' Die Katze palms a card into your hand from somewhere unseen."
