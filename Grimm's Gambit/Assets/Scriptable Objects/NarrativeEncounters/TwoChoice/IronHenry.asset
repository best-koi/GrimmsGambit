  description: '"Along the side of the road, you come across a man in a tattered
    coachman''s suit. His carriage long gone, the former driver appears forlorn,
    and a series of three iron bands are bound around his torso." ''You there. Lend
    an ear for but a moment to this poor, abandoned jockey, aye?'' ''I was once in
    service to a very powerful prince, and a right loyal servant I was. Faithful
    Heinrich they called me, they did. Ha ha... Those days are long gone. I''m certain
    my liege has croaked by now, being left alone in this treacherous forest. I bear
    these shackles about me as a reminder of him.'' "Looking closer, the man''s form
    seems to be severely constricted by those bands. Would it be prudent to remove
    them from him?" '
  choice1: '<Remove shackles> '
  choice2: '<Leave well enough alone> '
  choice1Outcome: '"With the help of your companions, you pry the iron bands from
    the man''s body. The effort leaves the four of you exhausted, but fulfilled nonetheless. 
    ''Ah... so that''s how it must be. ...Leave me now, traveler. I have much to
    consider.'' the weary man mutters toward you."  [Each party member gains +5 max
    HP, but loses 10 HP] '
  choice2Outcome: '"You decide to leave the man alone. If this was his choice to
    remember on, then it''s not your place to change it." ''Thank you for listening
    on, traveler. If you by some miracle manage to find my liege, tell him old Heinrich
    made it out okay.'' the coachman calls after you.  [No reward, but no punishment] '
