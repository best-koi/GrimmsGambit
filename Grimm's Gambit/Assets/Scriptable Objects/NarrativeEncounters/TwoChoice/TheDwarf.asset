  description: "\u201CWhile making your way through the woods, a small little man
    suddenly jumps out from the nearby brush, surprising everyone.\n\u2018Hold there
    wayward folk! The path you tread is most precarious, and you\u2019ll fall upon
    many follies if you are not careful! Here, you must eat this root and drink no
    water until sunset, it\u2019ll grant you the protection you need to finish your
    journey!\u2019\nThe little man gives you the root and disappears as suddenly
    as he came. You are left quite perplexed as to what to do with the root, as it
    looks quite unappetizing.\u201D\n"
  choice1: '<Eat the Root> '
  choice2: '<Throw it Away> '
  choice1Outcome: 'The root tastes horrid, leaving a disgusting aftertaste in your
    mouth. You feel sick for a while, but eventually the pain passes. You wonder
    what the root exactly did, if anything at all.

'
  choice2Outcome: "You throw it away, what you don\u2019t eat can\u2019t hurt you
    right?\n\n[No Reward, but No Punishments]"
