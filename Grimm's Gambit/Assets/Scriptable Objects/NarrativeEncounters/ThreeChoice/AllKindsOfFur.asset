  description: "\u201CMoving through the trees you begin to hear barking in the distance.
    As you come closer you see a woman  hiding in a tree wearing a thick cloak of
    several layers made from the furs of several different animals. At the base of
    the tree looks to be an elderly dog who is barking up at the figure in the tree.
    She spots your approach before the dog does.   At the sight of this all three
    of your party look as if they want to jump at the opportunity to take action.\u201D 
    Who should take the lead? "
  choice1: '<Let the Seamstress talk down the girl> '
  choice2: <Let Die Katze distract the dog>
  choice1Outcome: "\u201CThe seamstress walks calmly up to the girl in the tree.
    \u2018Are you alright, dear?\u2019 The Seamstress says beaming a weary smile
    towards the girl. \u201CDie Katze rolls their eyes, looking clearly annoyed and
    anxious at The Seamstress\u2019 boldness.  This old dog immediately turns its
    attention towards the Seamstress and begins to growl and bite at the Seamstress.
    She withdraws a small cloth doll from her basket and throws it in the opposite
    direction. The dog moves to go fetch the doll. The Seamstress puts out a hand
    to assist the girl and she begins to slowly descend from the tree. This girl
    covered in various furs hugs the Seamstress, handing her one of her fur pelts
    to wipe the bite mark of blood before running into the forest.  You push forward
    having successfully freed the girl.\u201D "
  choice2Outcome: "\u201CDie Katze approaches the old dog, drawing their weapon.\u201D 
    \u2018Come now, doggie. Leave the girl alone.\u2019 Die Katze flaunts, tapping
    the dog with the flat side of their blade.  \u201CThe Seamstress looks away,
    placing her face into her palm. Without warning the dog jumps on Die Katze knocking
    them to the ground, snatching their hat and running away. The Seamstress takes
    this opportunity to assist the girl down from the tree. She quickly thanks you
    before disappearing into the forest. A few moments later Die Katze returns slightly
    disheveled but having retrieved their hat.   You push forward having successfully
    freed the girl.\u201D "
  choice3: '<Let the Hound confront the dog> '
  choice3Outcome: "\u201CThe Hound approaches the dog and begins to match its barking.
    The two bark back and the Hound places itself between the older dog and the tree,
    getting ready to defend this figure. The two wrestle for a few minutes before
    the older dog, seeing its loss, begins to run away from the tree. The Hound stands
    triumphantly barking at the older dog as it flees. The rest of your party helps
    the girl down from the tree. She leans down smiling and petting the Hound as
    thanks for his bravery. She stands, smiles, and thanks your group for helping
    her, and walks into the forest before disappearing among the trees.  You push
    forward having successfully freed the girl.\u201D "
