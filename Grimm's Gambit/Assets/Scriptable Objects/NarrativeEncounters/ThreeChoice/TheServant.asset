  description: "\u201CAs you walk through the woods, you seem to have taken a wrong
    turn and have ended up at a dead end. A small cave lies at the end of this route,
    but you quickly get accosted by a strange individual running out of the cave
    with a white snake around his neck and an axe in hand.\n\u2018Stay back! Stay
    back, you fiends! I know why you\u2019re here, you\u2019re here to take my head
    for that devious Queen! I\u2019ve expected you all for a while now, so don\u2019t
    think I\u2019ll make it easy to take my life!\u2019\nThe man clearly seems deranged,
    reasoning with him may not prove fruitful. Moving in any way may also provoke
    him to attack.\u201D\n"
  choice1: <Fight>
  choice2: <Try and Reason with Him>
  choice1Outcome: "\u201CThe deranged man was tougher than he seemed, and quite accurate
    with that axe. After killing him, you find minor supplies inside the cave before
    finding your way back on the right road.\u201D\n[All Party Members Take 15 damage,
    gain 5 Max HP]\n"
  choice2Outcome: "\u201C\u2018Oh no, I know your tricks! The Queen is devious, you\u2019re
    just trying to get me to lower my guard! I won\u2019t let you kill me!\u2019\nThe
    deranged man charges at your party, but you quickly escape. He throws his axe
    after you screaming about how he\u2019ll survive, leaving a nasty cut on your
    arm.\u201D\n[All Party Members Take 5 damage]\n"

  choice3: '<Let the Hound Intimidate Him> '
  choice3Outcome: "\u201CThe Hound barks at the man intimidatingly, but instead of
    fleeing or fighting he begins to lower his axe.\n\u2018Oh! I didn\u2019t realize
    you were also victims of her schemes, my mistake! You must be on the run then,
    correct? I would\u2019ve done the same if it weren\u2019t for\u2026 nevermind.
    Let me give you some food, I have plenty, and it\u2019s not like I need to go
    anywhere\u2019\nAn unexpected outcome, but a welcome one. You leave wondering
    what exactly the Red Queen did to make a man act like that.\u201D\n[The Hound
    gains +10 Max Hp, all Party Members gain 5 HP.]\n"
