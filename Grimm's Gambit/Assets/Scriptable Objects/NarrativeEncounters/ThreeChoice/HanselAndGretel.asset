  description: "\u201CAs you walk down the path you begin to smell something sweet
    in the air\u2026 like pie and candied apples. You stumble into a small house
    off the side of the road with smoke coming from the chimney. As you get close
    the door opens and an old woman with a cheery expression and plump soft cheeks.
    She welcomes you inside, urging you to try a piece of her pie. Before you can
    say no she grabs you by the arm with unforeseen strength. She sits you down urging
    you to try one of her pies. Reluctantly you nibble a piece of the pie\u2026 
    Before this can continue further Die Katze jumps forward, drawing their weapon.\u201D 
    \u2018Okay, everything about this seems suspicious. We're leaving, and you\u2019re
    not going to stop us,\u201D Die Katze threatens towards the old lady.  \u201CShe
    pleads innocence, letting you walk out the door. As you walk away you look over
    your shoulder and see that cheery smile almost becomes a malicious smirk. Strangely,
    it feels as though you are forgetting something\u2026  Choose one thing to lose\u201D "
